# Anti-Virus-1.0
Anti-Virus 1.0 is a Anti-virus to scan POSSIBLE threats. It's NOT for deleting files as it is still in beta. If you do want a good anti-virus, then the greater option is a well known anti-virus like notron360. So as a note : PLEASE DO NOT TRUST THIS 100%. AND COULD ALSO LEAK TONS OF STUFF YOU DID NOT KNOW YOU HAD ON YOUR COMP (wait thats good lol)
